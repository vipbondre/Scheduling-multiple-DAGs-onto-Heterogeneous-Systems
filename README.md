# Scheduling-multiple-DAGs-onto-Heterogeneous-Systems
Area: Scheduling in Parallel and Distributed Systems

We have implemented two scheduling strategies based on fairness for scheduling multiple DAGs.
        
We have also implemented a Rank based scheduling algorithm (HEFT) for scheduling a single DAG. 

The above two policies work on the output of this strategy.
